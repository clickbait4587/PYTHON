Hello and welcome to my basement!
I'm "The hacking Knight" and my sword is all yours!


In this tutorial we're going to convert PDF to audio with Python.

So without furthure ado, let's kill the fool!

I assume you already have Python and pip installed on your system. If not, then pause this video and do so right now. I've provided links in the description below.

Great! Now that we all have Python installed, let's get to it!

First create a new folder and create two files in it: converterdot py and requirements.txt.
We will store the required libraries in the requirements.txt file.

Now copy and paste your PDF file into the directory alongside the two files.

I have a sample PDF file which contains some dummy text in it.

Open your code editor in that directory after pasting the file.

Open the requirements.txt file and list the required libraries: py-pdf2, py-ttsx3, and pike-pdf.
Now let's install them using the "pip install hyphen r requirements.txt" command.

Hopefully you will not get any errors.

Now we need to import the modules.
